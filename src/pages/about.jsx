                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a full stack JavaScript developer with a passion for creating. My interest in web development stems from my background in metal fabrication
                    and design, as well as my love for building computers. I have always enjoyed the process of creating something cool from nothing, and I discovered 
                    that web development is a great way to express myself creatively while also having the potential to solve real world problems. I graduated from the Full Stack 
                    Bootcamp at the university of California Davis in 2023, and I am excited to continue my journey as a web developer.
